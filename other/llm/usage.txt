This study delves into the intricate relationship between a football team's ball possession, as indicated by the number of times players touch the ball, and the team's scoring success. Through rigorous statistical analysis, we compared Poisson and negative binomial regression models to assess which better predicts the final score based on possession data. Our findings revealed a nuanced connection where more ball possession does not always equate to higher scores, challenging common football assumptions. The implications of this research extend beyond sports analytics, providing insights into the complex dynamics of performance metrics and their interpretation, thereby enriching the strategic understanding of team sports.

Please consider Maher (1982)"Previous authors have rejected the Poisson model for association football scores in favour of the Negative Binomial. This paper, however, investigates the Poisson model further. Parameters representing the teams' inherent attacking and defensive strengths are incorporated and the most appropriate model is found from a hierarchy of models. Observed and expected frequencies of scores are compared and goodness-of-fit tests show that although there are some small systematic differences, an independent Poisson model gives a reasonably accurate description of football scores. Improvements can be achieved by the use of a bivariate Poisson model with a correlation between scores of 0.2."discuss your choice between logistic, Poisson, and negative binomial regression.

write an introduction for my paper, follow below rules:
The introduction is self-contained and tells a reader everything they need to know including: 1) broader context to motivate; 2) some detail about what the paper is about; 3) a clear gap that needs to be filled; 4) what was done; 5) what was found; 6) why it is important; 7) the structure of the paper. A reader should be able to read only the introduction and know what was done, why, and what was found. Likely 3 or 4 paragraphs, or 10 per cent of total.

In the pursuit of understanding the dynamics of football, the correlation between game statistics and match outcomes has been a subject of continued research. While traditional analyses have focused on final scores as a direct measure of success, the intricate strategies behind ball possession and field dominance suggest a more complex interplay. Historical analyses, such as those by Maher in 1982, provided foundational insights by proposing models that encapsulate a team's offensive and defensive capabilities, prompting a shift from Poisson to Negative Binomial models based on the distribution of football scores. However, the advent of richer datasets and advanced statistical techniques warrants a reassessment of these classic models in contemporary contexts.

This paper bridges the historical perspective with modern analytical capabilities, revisiting the debate between logistic, Poisson, and Negative Binomial regression models. By incorporating parameters reflective of current playing strategies, our research critically examines the predictive power of each model in the context of today's game. The focus lies not only on goals but also on the frequency of ball contactsâ€”a proxy for ball possession and a potential indicator of a team's dominance on the pitch.

The gap in the literature becomes apparent when considering the evolution of football tactics and data analytics over the past decades. While previous studies have laid the groundwork, there is a need for an updated model that can accurately reflect contemporary football outcomes. To address this, our study integrates the latest match statistics to revisit the assumptions of historical models and test their validity in predicting modern football scores.

Our findings suggest a nuanced reality: while an independent Poisson model provides a baseline approximation, it is the Negative Binomial model that more accurately mirrors today's football scoring patterns. Notably, this paper uncovers the limitations of traditional modeling in capturing the complexities of modern football, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach to sports analytics.

This is more than an academic exercise; it has practical implications for coaches and analysts in optimizing team strategies and for the betting industry in setting odds that reflect the most likely outcomes. Understanding the relationship between possession and scoring can transform how we view and interpret football performances.

The paper unfolds as follows: After a comprehensive review of the literature, we detail our methodology, contrasting it with Maher's (1982) work. We then present our analytical findings, followed by a discussion of their implications for the football industry. Finally, we conclude with a summary of our contributions to the field and propose directions for future research.
